general style is a combination between medieval and modern. Lots of slate and
wood, but open plan layouts and not a lot of walls. Heavy curtains for
partitions or custom built modular partitions.

HVAC is 4 pipe system with localized ZCUs, as well as a global air
recirculation/filtration system. Also allows for adding local components to HVAC
loop such as water cooled computers or mini ZCUs.
